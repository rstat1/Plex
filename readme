Scripts currently included only allow for build on Linux (or Cygwin I guess, not tested)

They will require
	-- qemu
	-- sh
	-- gcc (or g++ rather)
	-- nasm

Two scripts included, one "make-kernel" just builds the kernel. I use it to make sure I haven't broken the build with errors or missing files. The other run-qemu, well I think this one is pretty self-explainatory.
